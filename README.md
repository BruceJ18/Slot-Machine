# Slot-Machine
Utilized javascript to build a slot machine's logic.


    I created a small slot machine project using javascript. At the top I have the layout of the steps that I went through to complete the project and right below that are some imports followed by some global variables. The import I used for this particular project is called prompt-sync.
